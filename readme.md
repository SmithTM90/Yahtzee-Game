Yahtzee!

This is a javascript and jQuery focused rendition of the classic game, Yahtzee. I made it over the course of 4 days, and hope to update it some time in the future, enjoy!

##Getting Started

* Run `npm install` to install dependencies

##Commands
* `npm start` - start the BrowserSync server

The game feautres randomly generated dice rolls, a clickable score card, the ability to hold your dice just like in the real game, as well as having the score card add up your totals for you. No math for you! Unless you want to check my game logic :).

The styling of the yahtzee game was partly created with BootStrap.

Known Issues:
  -The 'yahtzee bonus' section of the score card may not be working quite right.
  -clicking on a score card section multiple times may cause your scores to come out wrong.
  -The rules button doesn't do anything at this time.
